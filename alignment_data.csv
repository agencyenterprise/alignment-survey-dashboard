[Here I exclude work of the ""repeatable"" type where arxiv has 1000 papers written by people who are insufficiently bright or too institutionally bought-in to realize their work would provide no marginal value. I think EA funders can already recognize these topics when they see them and adjust accordingly; and also know that even within areas of this type, highly talented people can do good work.]

Alignment is still not ""mainstream"" enough to be a universal talent attractor; it is not yet high-status with the public. I expect the next big OpenAI run will create public knowledge that may help with this. High compensation and/or high-profile prizes would help too. Of course this also brings in the conformists and the status-seekers and will advance the cultural decay clock; but the most important constraint is the number of smart people on the problem, so it's a net win.

I believe model editing / knowledge editing is under-rated by the LW community; the academic community does much more of this, and it is good that they are investing in it. I like the academic labs of Chris Potts, Jacob Andreas, and David Bau in no particular order.

I think ""black box"" approaches to interp and control, where we train a secondary AI to inspect/interpret or control the primary AI, are rather dramatically under-investigated, and we should be doing much more of this. It is neglected right now because we have only recently made LLMs that are smart enough to even consider trying (e.g. by giving them general-purpose instructions that they can understand.). I think the pro-black-box people are busy building current AI, the anti-black-box people are busy trying to do interp on current models, and too few are investigating experimenting with model architectures that can scale up to ""grey-box"" interp and control done by smarter AI's

Search in directions that are hard to make legible.
Why: we have no good metric of alignment progress. We have no easy way to judge the promise of a project/person/org aiming to search in new directions. Feedback loops are long, and feedback is sparse. We have no way to have confidence a particular judgement mechanism is any good (the obvious ways fail because they introduce precisely the incentives we need to avoid here: legibility, publication, agreement of many other researchers, obviously-superficially-good near-term outcomes...).","The answer depends on who we're calling an alignment researcher.
Vs the typical researcher, I'd say alignment researchers are more open to new ideas and less rigorous (in some ways this is justified: the less understood a field, the more evidence will be hard to make rigorous; using only respectably rigorous evidence is a way to be respectable but systematically incorrect in some respects; in other ways, many could do better by trying for more rigor where possible), probably less focused on publication.
I think it's important to be careful what is concluded from any of this: [typical alignment researcher] properties tell you about selection effects in getting/remaining in the field. They don't tell you much about the alignment problem, or what the selection effects ought to be.","I have thoughts.

The field has no fit-for-purpose self-correction mechanisms. (most naive proxies that are or could be used for this are bad)

The field has no good way to measure impact. ""Impactful"" tends to mean ""I like this"" or ""this makes significant changes that seem good"". Are the changes positive in terms of the eventual outcome, or do they just score high on some proxy i happen to like?

The impact of [change] on [the direction of the field] is probably the most important factor in most cases, and one that's so hard to measure that no-one ends up bothering.
E.g. I add this new appealing research direction - does it take researchers away from more useful things? Does it attract a bunch of new researchers? Do those researchers create new directions? Do those directions take other researchers away from more useful things? Does it tend to lead to overconfidence?

There's a temptation to say ""sure, but how much do all these higher-order effects really matter?"" - but the answer there is that they matter little when the field has a great [alignment progress] metric - but we do not.

On the survey itself, I think many of the questions aren't great. And/or the issues are too complex for a simple answer to be informative, so that you're likely to draw foolish conclusions.

E.g. there's something like ""are the following alignment research areas promising""
Promising *for what*?
I can believe that some approaches may be promising to buy us a little time, and not promising at all to solve the problem (beyond the instrumental time buying).

I can believe the a particular area is both [required to solve the problem], and [almost certain to be too slow if we don't buy a lot of time by other means].
Is this ""promising""?

In the same question there's ""Understanding current models... evals...""
Understanding *what*? What kind of evals?
I think Understanding current models in a deep, principled way would be hugely useful. I think that very little work on current evals is promising or efficient in achieving this, and that we're nowhere close to the kinds of understanding that'd be useful. I nonetheless think that some can be instrumentally useful.

Or [is x required in order to be an alignment researcher?]. Suppose I believe that 98% of alignment researchers should have x. Is it *required*? No. But that doesn't tell you much.
It's also not clear whether I'm supposed to answer based on marginal changes to the current field, or based on the field of my dreams - I.e. perhaps the efficient approach to alignment research would involve 5% non-x people, but adding 5% non-x people to the current field setup would not help.


The overall survey population is also an issue (not just due to standard [who bothers to answer?] reasons).
Suppose that the field looks nothing like it should, such that a part of the field that currently includes 70% of researchers ought ideally to include 15%.
That's going to hugely warp the results.

If your population is [people on the road to x], then you'll tend to hear that travelling to x is a good idea.
This doesn't tell you much about the desirability of travelling to x.

There's not an impartial/objective way around this. It's very possible that you should largely ignore large sections of the field, and take account of some outside the field. But which to ignore? Which to take account of?

It's not obviously silly to do an even-weighted analysis of those currently in the field.
It *is* obviously silly to assume that this was, in fact, the best population to ask (the fact that it's hard to find a better answer does not make your answer good - it can mean that we're all too confused to find a good answer).

Again, all this comes back to having no good metric/feedback signal for alignment progress. "

The type of kid that seriously competes for national math Olympiads.  The type of kid that lots of us used to be) feels neglected to me.  If AGI hits 5-15 years from now, then such investments will not be helpful.  But if AGI hits 15-25 years from now, then it's likely that some of these students will be extremely effective, and a well-placed mentor is the difference between a great student joining the field, and a great student going into finance.  These kinds of outreach efforts have relatively low cost and high payoff, but that payoff is very delayed.

I suspect this is neglected because of a combination of short timelines, an excitement about getting one's hands dirty over doing field-building work, and fears of rejection from trying to broadly communicate this very weird idea that AI safety needs to be taken seriously.  I think it is worth increasing our recruiting pipeline because, frankly, if AGI hits in 5-15 years, we're probably already screwed.  We should play to our outs.

This is part of what makes me excited about programs like AISC and SERI MATS.  These programs are phenomenally cheap for a lot of exposure and recruitment.  Large companies spend massive amounts of time and money on talent acquisition, but I get the sense that there is a lot of talent that _wants_ to work on alignment research, and acquiring it would be relatively cheap.  Case in point:  I am a low-level Google software engineer currently going through AISC and in the process of leaving Google so that I can focus on alignment research.  AISC made that decision much easier, and I would like to see more programs like it that help grow the field.

I also think that the field spends too much time looking for controllability and not enough time looking for coexistence.  I think that trying to control something that is more intelligent than we are is a fool's errand, and we should either not build it or seek to coexist.  Plus, even if we control it, who is ""we?""  There are a lot of humans out there who would exploit this control to create a seriously bad world.

I suspect coexistence approaches are neglected because people want humanity to still, somehow, ""come out on top.""  But success at controllability seems unlikely to me (and possibly even undesirable).  

I see the most promise in approaches that think of AGI as a child species that we are trying to raise well.  Hopefully we do a good enough job at it that that, even after it has surpassed us, an AGI views us as dim-witted but revered ancestors and still wants us to do well.  You know, the way many humans help our their grandparents from time to time, but mostly let them do their thing.  This means that I am more interested in trying to encourage ""good"" values in future AIs and helping them make reasonable changes to those values (rather than going insane or getting trapped in some weird edge case, as many current systems do) moreso than I am in trying to precisely specify goals or deeply understand what an AI system is doing.","Actual alignment research is relatively unfunded right now, so one has to make a difficult and conscious decision to actually _be_ an alignment researcher.  Accordingly, I suspect that a typical alignment researcher is either way more driven or way better off financially than a typical EA/rationalist type.  But I have not been in the field long enough to really have a sense of this.","Honestly?  There's too much gloom and doom.  If, as I suspect, we have a lot of depressed people working on alignment, I want to uh... remind them to have a good time?  So far, no human has managed to live to be 125 years old -- something always gets them.  Dying to robots isn't somehow worse than dying to war or cancer.  You really have to focus on enjoying your life at the same time as you're trying to survive.  The enjoyment part is the thing that makes it worth surviving at all, and it keeps you sane to boot.

I'm glad that you've run this survey.  These are really interesting questions."

The ethical considerations surrounding AI systems vary across different cultural contexts, yet this dimension often receives insufficient attention in alignment discussions. Understanding cultural nuances is essential for developing globally applicable ethical frameworks and ensuring the responsible deployment of AI ","Typical alignment researchers exhibit a diverse array of qualities that distinguish them from individuals in other domains. They possess a unique blend of technical expertise, ethical acumen, and interdisciplinary collaboration skills. Unlike laypersons, alignment researchers delve deep into complex theoretical and practical aspects of AI ethics, striving to bridge the gap between technological advancements and ethical considerations. Moreover, they often demonstrate a strong commitment to societal welfare, aligning their research efforts with the principles of effective altruism and rationalist inquiry.","In the current landscape of alignment research, there is a growing recognition of the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement. As AI technologies continue to evolve, it becomes imperative to foster dialogue across diverse domains, including computer science, ethics, law, sociology, and philosophy. By embracing a multi-disciplinary approach, alignment researchers can gain fresh insights, anticipate potential risks, and develop inclusive frameworks that prioritize human values and dignity. Furthermore, promoting transparency and accountability in AI development processes remains paramount to building trust and addressing societal concerns surrounding AI alignment."
